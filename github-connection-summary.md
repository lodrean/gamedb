## Current Status

After analyzing your project, here's the current status regarding Git and GitHub integration:

✅ **Git is initialized**: Your project already has a `.git` directory, indicating Git is properly initialized.

✅ **Git user configuration is set up**:
- Username: Lodrean

3. **Rename your branch from "master" to "main"**: This is included in the connection commands and is important for aligning with GitHub's conventions.

4. **Push your code to GitHub**: After connecting, push your code to make it available on GitHub.

5. **Verify the connection**: Check that the remote is correctly set up using `git remote -v`.
